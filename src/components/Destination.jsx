                    <h2>Shwedagon Pagoda , Yangon</h2>
                    <p>
                    Shwedagon Pagoda is a gilded stupa located in Yangon, Myanmar. 
                    It is the most sacred Buddhist pagoda in Myanmar, as it is believed to contain relics
                     of the four previous Buddhas of the present kalpa. These relics include the staff of
                      Kakusandha, the water filter of Koṇāgamana, a piece of the robe of Kassapa, and eight
                       strands of hair from the head of Gautama1. The pagoda was constructed more than 2,
                        years ago while Buddha was still alive which would make it the oldest Buddhist stupa
                         in the world2. The pagoda stands 112 m (367 ft) tall and dominates the Yangon skyline.
                          Yangon’s zoning regulations, which cap the maximum height of buildings to 127 metres
                           (417 feet) above sea level
                     (75% of the pagoda’s sea level height), ensure the Shwedagon’s prominence in the city’s skyline

                    <h2>Kyaiktiyo Pagoda , Kyaikhto , Mon State</h2>
                    <p>
                    Kyaiktiyo Pagoda , also known as Golden Rock is a well-known Buddhist pilgrimage site in Mon State,
                     Myanmar. It is a small pagoda (7.3 m (24 ft)) built 
                     on the top of a granite boulder covered with gold leaves pasted 
                     on by its male worshippers.According to legend, the Golden Rock 
                     itself is precariously perched on a strand of Lord Buddha's hair.
                      The balancing rock seems to defy gravity, as it perpetually appears 
                      to be on the verge of rolling down the hill. The rock and the pagoda 
                      are at the top of Mt. Kyaiktiyo. Another legend states that a Buddhist
                       monk impressed the celestial king with his asceticism and the celestial
                        king used his supernatural powers to carry the rock to its current place, 
                        specifically choosing the rock for its resemblance to the monk's head. It 
                        is the third most important Buddhist pilgrimage site in Burma after the
                         Shwedagon Pagoda and the Mahamuni Pagoda.
