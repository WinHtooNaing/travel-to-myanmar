            <p className='p2'>The country of Myanmar is still quite much ruins of a period of more than 50 years under the military regime, but fortunately now the political situation is getting better when a government is trusted by the people to lead. It is easy to see that the places need conservation, the historical sites they still preserve and promote extremely well, and for the cities that need economic development such as Yangon or Mandalay, they have a long term of vision and planning. In Yangon, there are no motorbikes, motorbikes only run in the small roads and alleys.

            <p style={{marginBottom : "30px"}}>I came to Myanmar during the time when it had a strong earthquake in Bagan, many temples were badly damaged. But it seems that this doesn’t matter too much, still being a peaceful Buddhist country, people are really kind, hospitable and willing to help strangers. Today I heard somewhere on the television saying that Myanmar, they are ranked #1 in the world for charity, helping others, even though they are still a very poor country.
                 They are still one of the safest countries to travel.</p>
